# Quick Connect

Starting with Jellyfin server version 10.7.0 and supported clients, you can use Quick Connect to sign in to your account without the need of a password.

## Enabling Quick Connect

To use Quick Connect, you have to enble it for the server in the server dashboard. Each user who wants to use it has to enable it in the user settings.

## Using Quick Connect

If your Jellyfin Client supports Quick Connect, it will generate a 6 digit code which you have to enter in the user settings with an already signed-in session. After each successful Quick Connect sign-in, you have to renable Quick Connect if you want to use it again.
